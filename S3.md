    - Lower storage cost but higher retrieval fees compared to Standard.
    - Use case: Infrequently accessed data but needs quick retrieval (e.g., backups).
4. **One Zone-IA:**
    
    - Similar to Standard-IA but stored in a single AZ.
    - Lower cost but less resilient.
    - Use case: Data that can be recreated if lost (e.g., secondary backups).
5. **Glacier Instant Retrieval:**
    
    - Low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data with immediate retrieval.
    - Use case: Archive data requiring frequent access.
6. **Glacier Flexible Retrieval:**
    
    - Low-cost archive storage with retrieval in minutes or hours.
    - Use case: Long-term backups.
7. **Glacier Deep Archive:**
    
    - Lowest-cost storage, with retrieval in 12+ hours.
    - Use case: Archival of rarely accessed data.
