### **AWS Elastic Beanstalk - Overview for SysOps Admin Exam**

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of web applications and services. It abstracts infrastructure management, allowing developers and administrators to focus on application development.

### **Core Concepts**

1. **What Elastic Beanstalk Does:**
    
    - Automatically handles provisioning of resources like EC2, RDS, and ELB.
    - Manages deployment, monitoring, scaling, and patching.
    - Supports multiple languages and platforms, such as Java, Python, Ruby, Node.js, .NET, PHP, and Docker.
2. **How Elastic Beanstalk Works:**
    
    - Upload application code and configuration.
    - Elastic Beanstalk provisions and manages the required AWS resources based on the application’s needs.
    - Offers automatic scaling, monitoring, and updates.

### **Key Components**

1. **Application:**
    
    - The top-level container for Elastic Beanstalk environments.
    - Can contain multiple environments (e.g., staging, production).
2. **Environment:**
    
    - A deployment of the application, consisting of AWS resources.
    - Two types:
        - **Web Server Environment:** Handles HTTP and HTTPS traffic with an ELB.
        - **Worker Environment:** Processes background tasks (e.g., queues via SQS).
3. **Environment Tiers:**
    
    - **Web Server Tier:** For running web applications that handle HTTP requests.
    - **Worker Tier:** For running background tasks that consume messages from an SQS queue.
4. **Environment Configuration:**
    
    - Configurable settings for EC2 instances, scaling, load balancers, and more.
    - Includes options for instance type, key pairs, and auto-scaling policies.
5. **Application Versions:**
    
    - Elastic Beanstalk maintains a history of uploaded application versions.
    - Allows rolling back to previous versions if needed.

### **Key Features**

1. **Platform Support:**
    
    - Built-in support for popular platforms such as Docker, Python, Java, .NET, and Ruby.
    - Custom platforms can also be created using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model.
2. **Autoscaling:**
    
    - Automatically scales instances based on application load.
    - Scaling policies can be defined in environment configuration.
3. **Monitoring:**
    
    - Integrates with CloudWatch to provide metrics for CPU, memory, and health status.
    - Elastic Beanstalk health monitoring tracks application availability and performance.
4. **Deployment Policies:**
    
    - **All at once:** Deploys the new version to all instances simultaneously.
    - **Rolling:** Deploys the new version to a few instances at a time.
    - **Rolling with additional batch:** Adds new instances temporarily during deployment.
    - **Immutable:** Launches a separate set of instances for the new version, minimizing downtime.
5. **Managed Updates:**
    
    - Elastic Beanstalk can apply minor updates to the environment platform automatically.
6. **Custom Resource Configurations:**
    
    - Elastic Beanstalk allows modifying the environment by attaching additional resources like RDS, DynamoDB, or custom security groups.
7. **Blue/Green Deployments:**
    
    - Simplifies launching a new environment with a new version, then switching traffic to the new environment.

### **Integration with Other AWS Services**

1. **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB or NLB):**
    
    - Distributes traffic to instances running your application.
2. **EC2 Instances:**
    
    - Core compute resources managed by Elastic Beanstalk.
3. **Auto Scaling:**
    
    - Elastic Beanstalk uses Auto Scaling to scale instances up or down based on defined rules.
4. **CloudWatch:**
    
    - Monitors application health and resource metrics.
5. **S3:**
    
    - Stores application versions and logs.
6. **RDS:**
    
    - Can be provisioned as part of an Elastic Beanstalk environment.

### **Common Use Cases**

1. **Rapid Deployment of Applications:**
    
    - Quickly deploy applications without managing infrastructure manually.
2. **Managed Scaling and Monitoring:**
    
    - Offloads infrastructure scaling and monitoring to Elastic Beanstalk.
3. **Continuous Deployment Pipelines:**
    
    - Use Elastic Beanstalk as part of a CI/CD pipeline for deploying new versions.
4. **Application Health Monitoring:**
    
    - Simplifies monitoring with health checks and integrated CloudWatch metrics.

### **Key Exam Topics**

1. **Deployment Strategies:**
    
    - Know the differences between deployment methods (e.g., rolling, immutable).
    - Understand how Elastic Beanstalk handles traffic during updates.
2. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting:**
    
    - Familiarity with Elastic Beanstalk logs and CloudWatch integration for troubleshooting.
    - Understand how to resolve environment health issues.
3. **Environment Management:**
    
    - Switching between environments (e.g., Blue/Green deployments).
    - Rolling back to a previous application version.
4. **Scaling Policies:**
    
    - Elastic Beanstalk leverages Auto Scaling. Be familiar with configuration and monitoring.
5. **Managed Platform Updates:**
    
    - Understand how Elastic Beanstalk applies updates and how to configure it.
6. **Security:**
    
    - Role of IAM in Elastic Beanstalk (e.g., instance profiles for accessing S3, RDS).
    - Managing security groups and instance access.

### **Exam Tips**

1. **Understand Core Architecture:**
    
    - Know the relationship between Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling, and CloudWatch.
2. **Health Monitoring:**
    
    - Be prepared to troubleshoot “Degraded” or “Severe” health states in Elastic Beanstalk.
3. **Customizations:**
    
    - Be familiar with customizing instance types, AMIs, and adding additional resources like RDS.
4. **Cost Implications:**
    
    - Elastic Beanstalk itself is free, but it provisions resources (e.g., EC2, S3) that incur charges.
5. **Know Deployment Scenarios:**
    
    - When to use **Immutable Deployments** (e.g., high availability environments).
    - When to use **Blue/Green Deployments** (e.g., major version changes with minimal risk).
6. **Logs and Metrics:**
    
    - Know how to access logs (via AWS Console or CLI) and monitor application metrics.
