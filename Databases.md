        - Provisioned: Fixed read/write capacity, with auto-scaling as an option.
3. **Performance:**
    
    - Single-digit millisecond latency for reads and writes.
    - Use indexes (Global Secondary Indexes and Local Secondary Indexes) to optimize queries.
4. **Use Cases:**
    
    - Real-time applications (e.g., gaming leaderboards, IoT data).
    - Serverless web apps.

### **4. Amazon Redshift**

1. **Overview:**
    
    - Fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse optimized for analytics.
2. **Key Features:**
    
    - **Clusters:** Composed of a leader node (query coordination) and compute nodes (data storage and processing).
    - **Columnar Storage:** Efficient data compression and retrieval for analytical workloads.
    - **Redshift Spectrum:** Query S3 data directly without loading it into Redshift.
    - **Materialized Views:** Pre-compute query results for faster retrieval.
3. **Performance Optimization:**
    
    - Use distribution keys and sort keys for data placement and retrieval.
    - Enable concurrency scaling for high-traffic workloads.
4. **Data Loading:**
    
    - Load data from S3, DynamoDB, or other databases using COPY command or AWS Glue.
5. **Use Cases:**
    
    - Business intelligence, analytics, and reporting.

### **5. Data Migration and Integration**

1. **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS):**
    
    - Migrate on-premises or cloud-hosted databases to AWS with minimal downtime.
    - Supports homogenous (e.g., MySQL to RDS MySQL) and heterogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle to Aurora PostgreSQL).
2. **Integration:**
    
    - Use AWS Glue to prepare and load data into databases.
    - Combine with Lambda and Step Functions for ETL workflows.

### **6. Monitoring and Performance Tuning**

1. **Monitoring:**
    
    - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor database metrics like CPU utilization, storage usage, and query throughput.
    - Enable **Enhanced Monitoring** for granular insights into RDS performance.
    - Use **Performance Insights** for identifying slow queries and bottlenecks.
2. **Performance Tuning:**
    
    - RDS:
        - Adjust instance size or storage type (e.g., from GP2 to IO1 for IOPS).
        - Use read replicas to scale read-heavy workloads.
    - DynamoDB:
        - Optimize partition keys to distribute traffic evenly.
